# Features

## Servers

You can add multiple servers to your SaaScape deployment to provide load balancing and high availability for your applications. Additionally, when adding a server you can choose between creating a new swarm cluster or joining an existing one.

## Applications

Manage unlimited applications with their own unique plans, versions and instances. Link your Docker Hub account to allow for a seamless integration between application versions and Docker Hub, automating the updating of your instances.

## Domains

Add domains to SaaScape, allowing for automation of NGINX configuration and SSL certificates by Lets Encrypt. Also apply application specific NGINX directives.

## Instances

Powered by Docker Swarm, you can easily manage deployments of your application by creating multiple instances each with their own environment variables and secrets. Instances can be scaled across multiple servers using replicas and performance restrictions can be applied. You can have an instance for each tenant of your application.
